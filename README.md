# personal-notes-app
 full stack CRUD app

Mini Project: Personal Notes App
Objective: Build a basic app where users can create, read, update, and delete (CRUD) personal notes.
Features:
Backend:
Use Nest.js to create an API with the following endpoints:
POST /notes: Add a new note (fields: title, content, createdAt).
GET /notes: Retrieve all notes.
PUT /notes/:id: Update a specific note.
DELETE /notes/:id: Delete a specific note.
Store data in a MongoDB collection (notes).
Add basic input validation (e.g., title is required).
Frontend:
Use a Next.js app to:
Display the list of notes.
Include a form to add/edit a note.
Allow deleting notes via a button.
Bonus (Optional):
Use a lightweight CSS framework like Tailwind or Bootstrap for styling.
Add sorting by createdAt.
Estimated Time Allocation:
Backend: 30–45 minutes to set up MongoDB and Express API.
Frontend: 45–60 minutes to create a React UI and connect to the API.
Assessment Focus:
Backend: Can the candidate design a simple API and use MongoDB effectively?
Frontend: Can they handle state management and API calls in React?
Overall: Clean, functional code and basic error handling.
